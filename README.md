<strong>Select</strong> two tasks a program could perform that would be useful to a small business.

Each task must include the following:

<ul>

 <li>A conditional step</li>

 <li>Some form of iteration</li>

</ul>

Example tasks include the following:

<ul>

 <li>Entering a number of items and calculating sales tax on a sale; include a step offering a warranty for each item</li>

 <li>Converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius or the reverse over temperatures for several days</li>

 <li>Figuring out a total bulk sale price based on price per unit and number of units</li>

</ul>

These items may build on the tasks used in your Week Two assignment or may be unique.

<strong>Obtain</strong> approval from your instructor for your items by sending a Private Message.

<strong>Be sure to get my permission. BOTH programs must use BOTH selection AND iteration.</strong>




<strong>Create</strong> a 1/2-page Word document for each of the tasks. Each document should include:

<ul>

 <li>A brief description of the task</li>

 <li>The pseudocode associated with the task. Base the pseudocode on the examples provided in Chs. 4, 5, and 6 of Prelude to Programming.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Create</strong> Visual Logic<sup>Â®</sup> files to execute each of the tasks.
